You are given an array of integers. Except one element, each element occurs twice.
So, you need to find the non-duplicate element.

Input: Array of integers
Output: Non-duplicate element

Example:
Input: [3, 6, 1, 0, 6, 0, 1]
Ouput: 3

Explanation: Except 3 all other elements occur twice in the array.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
